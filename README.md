# U-Value Calculator

The U-Value Calculator is a simple tool for calculating the U-value (thermal transmittance) of building components. It helps estimate the rate of heat loss through a component based on its materials and dimensions.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface
- Calculates U-value based on material, thickness, and thermal conductivity
- Automatic update of U-value result as inputs are entered or modified

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included in standard Python installations)

## Installation
